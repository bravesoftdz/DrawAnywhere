# DrawAnywhere

Use mouse to draw anything on top of screen.

## Motivation

I just want to draw a rectangle by mouse on a playing video screen, but most tools will do a snapshot firstly,
so the video will freeze at that moment, that's not what I want.
Finally I decide to write my own tool.

## Build

This project is developed in Delphi 2007 without 3rd party component used.

## Usage

## OS

This tool runs under Windows.

### Install

Just copy `DrawAnywhere.exe` at anywhere in Windows.

### Launch

When launched, it will bring itself on top most to cover screen.
It will be transparent initially.

### Draw rectangle

Use mouse to click down, drag and up, so the yellow rectangle is drawn.

### Clear

Press "c" key to clear screen.

### Quit

Press `ESC` key to quit it.

### Change alpha

`Up` and `Down` key will adjust alpha value.

### Change pen width

`Left` and `Right` key will adjust pen width.
